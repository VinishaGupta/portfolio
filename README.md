## 🌍 Deployment
🚀 Live Application

Frontend (Vercel):
```bash
https://your-portfolio.vercel.app
```

Backend (Render):
```bash
https://portfolio-bmmn.onrender.com
```


## 🏗️ Deployment Architecture

This project follows a separated deployment architecture:

```
User (Browser)
      ↓
Frontend (React + Vite) → Hosted on Vercel
      ↓ API Calls
Backend (Node.js + Express) → Hosted on Render
      ↓
JSON Response (/api/profile)
```

## 🔗 How Frontend & Backend Are Connected

The frontend communicates with the backend using REST API calls.

Backend API Endpoint
```
GET /api/profile
```

This endpoint returns profile data in JSON format, which is dynamically rendered on the frontend.

## 🌐 Environment Configuration

To connect the frontend with the deployed backend, an environment variable is used.

In Vercel:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://portfolio-bmmn.onrender.com
```

In the frontend code:
```
fetch(`${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/api/profile`)
```
